I am Mark, a Web Developer with an interest in Machine Learning and Data Science, currently located in the northern part of Greece.

My main tech tools at the moment are:

```
##
#
# Python (for web but also working with data)
# Django (Python + JS + HTML/CSS)
# WordPress (PHP + JS + HTML/CSS)
# Linux
#
##
```

Welcome to my website then. Hopefully I won't leave it empty and occasionally add stuff such as thoughts, ideas and various experiment results. Hope to see you again, soon!
